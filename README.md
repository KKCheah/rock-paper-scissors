# Rock_Paper_Sciccors
This is my 2nd project on TOP, dated 24th May 2021
This is my baby steps for the future

Want to relearn git as I've not touched it for a month. Looking to see how "git status" will change after staging it and changing the README.md contents

Will see how things go and try to optimize the process by starting to thread more on projects to kickstart my portfolio. Attempt to commit and push this update to my GitHub account and repository.

8/6/2021 - Attempt to give it a UI based on player playing the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.

9/6/2021 - Completed the basics of implementing buttons and using DOM manipulation to allow user input via buttons, will need to refactor for redundancy and    optimization once I am more comfortable working with DOM
